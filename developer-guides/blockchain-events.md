# Blockchain Events

## Definition

Events are the Solidity abstraction on top of the EVM's logging functionality.

> Events are inheritable members of contracts. When you call them, they cause the arguments to be stored in the transaction’s log - a special data structure in the blockchain. These logs are associated with the address of the contract, are incorporated into the blockchain, and stay there as long as a block is accessible. The Log and its event data is not accessible from within contracts.

## Contracts

Contracts being used by GoodDAPP logs different information in the form of events.

The list of contracts that GoodDAPP is aware of:

value: the amount of G$ (in wei) being transferred
```

#### Transfer\(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value, bytes data\)

* **when:** Every time a user generates a link to share G$s in Send screen.
* **where:** In Send flow, user is able to generate a link to later be withdrawn by calling `GoodDollar.transferAndCall()`.

```yaml
from: who sent the G$
to: to whom the G$ was sent

data: encoded ABI to be called after G$ transfer
```

#### TransactionFees\(uint256 fee, uint256 burned\)

* **when:** Every time a Transfer is done.
* **where:** In Send flow, user is able to send G$s to another wallet by specifying its address, email, mobile or username, or by generating a link to later be withdrawn by calling `GoodDollar.transfer()`, `GoodDollar.transferAndCall()`. 

```yaml
fee: fee being charged for the transaction (in wei).
     And transferred to the GoodDollarReserve contract.

```

#### OwnershipTransferred\(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner\)
